// Concatination  in Js

//?   In  JavaScript, the + sing  is  not  only  us   for  arithmetic  addition  but  also  for string concatination . 
//   When the  + operator is used between two strings, it concatenates  the  string  togather.
//?  It's important to note  that  if  any  operend  of  the  +  operator   is  a  string  , JavaScript  will treat the  other 
    //  operands  as strings  as well,

    const str = "Hello " + "world";
    console.log(str);
